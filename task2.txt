The Document Object (`document`) :

 1.The `document` object represents the web page
 itself, encapsulating the entire HTML structure and its contents

 2.  It serves as the entry point to manipulate and interact with
the web page's elements

1. HTML Structure

    The `document` object provides access to the hierarchical structure
of the HTML content It allows developers to select and modify individual 
elements like paragraphs, headings, images, and more.

2. Methods

      The `document` object offers methods like `getElementById`, 
  `getElementsByClassName`, and `querySelectorAll`, enabling 
   developers to traverse and manipulate elements efficiently. 
   These methods aid in selecting specific elements based on IDs, 
   classes, or other attributes.

   3. Content Manipulation
      Developers can use the `document` object to dynamically 
   alter the content and appearance of web page elements. 
   This includes modifying text, attributes, and even adding 
   or removing elements

*The Window Object (`window`)* :

    1. The `window` object represents the browser window or 
    tab that displays the web page.

    2. It provides a broader scope of functionalities related 
    to the browser environment and user interactions. 

    3.  Here are some key features of the `window` object


1. Global Scope

        The `window` object is the global object in the browser's 
     JavaScript environment. This means that variables and 
     functions declared without the `var`, `let`, or `const` 
     keywords are automatically attached to the `window` object.


2. Browser Interaction

        The `window` object enables developers to control browser 
     behavior, such as opening new windows or tabs, navigating 
     history, and manipulating the location of the current page.

     3. Timers and Events
        it provides methods like `setTimeout` and `setInterval` to 
     schedule code execution after specific time intervals. 
     Additionally, the `window` object facilitates event handling 
     through methods like `addEventListener`.

     4. Browser Information
         The `window` object provides information about the 
     browser and the screen, such as dimensions, user 
     agent details, and viewport size.


 *Key Differences*

      1. Scope
           The `document` object deals specifically with the 
     content of the web page, allowing manipulation of 
     HTML elements and their attributes. The `window` 
     object, on the other hand, focuses on the broader 
     browser environment and user interactions.

      2. Methods and Properties
           The `document` object provides methods and properties 
     for selecting, modifying, and navigating HTML elements. 
     The `window` object offers methods for managing the browser 
     window, handling events, and interacting with the browser.

     3. Global vs. Specific

          While both objects are part of the DOM, the `window` object 
     has a global scope in the browser's JavaScript environment, 
     whereas the `document` object focuses on the structure and 
     content of the web page itself.
